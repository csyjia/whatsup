#######   About the project ############
This project is a chatting program that use socket programming. 
This program has a multiple-client, single-server architecture and 
all the communication between clients are through the server. 
Each client can login the server and send message to all the clients, 
the groups and one specific client. 
Also, the server provides some services such as blocking, online users view and so on.  
Because of the architecture we have, chatting messaging should be non-blocking. 
Servers use multiple threading to handle multiple clients at a time and clients are 
able to deal with connections and user input at the same time.
